# TheHitCount
This service should make a search against two or more search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo, Twitter, Web Search, Algolia, AltaVistaâ€¦) and present the total number of search hits from each search engine. If the user enters several words, this service should make a search for each word, summarize the number of hits, and then present the sum from each search engine.

## Projects
There are 5 projects in this solution

1. **Web**: A simple website with an input field so that users can make a search.
2. **Rest**: A simple rest api that accepts post request to make a search.
3. **Core**: Implements the HitCountService. All the logics are written here.
4. **Functions**: Implements a Durable Funciton to orchestrate search for different search engines.
5. **Common**: Common dependency for the other project.

The key ideas behind this projects are -
* Seperation of concerns.
* Use concurrently running tasks to make search quicker (way 1).
* Use orchestration mechanism to make search quicker (way 2).
